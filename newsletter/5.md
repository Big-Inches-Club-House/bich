## Vote for Zenon Tools

We are thrilled to give [Zenon Tool's proposal](https://forum.zenon.org/t/zenon-tools-back-pay-for-work-delivered/587) our first ever VIGOROUS rating.  

See the full Proposal Analysis [Here](https://github.com/Big-Inches-Club-House/bich/discussions/3)

There are many deserving proposals and we will rate them in time.  
However, BICH DAO believes there has been no community member who has been as diligent, yet so unjustly under-compensated as Vilkris and the Zenon Tool's project.

Zenon Tools began as a WarpDrive project and quickly became an essential community tool.  
During the distribution of WarpDrive funding, BICH DAO's founder encouraged maximum funding of the few projects which had created tangible value.  
Several WarpDrive judges wanted to earmark Warpdrive funds for projects that hadn't delivered anything, and also place additional requirements on projects to receive full payouts.  
Yet these same judges now make and support proposals requesting far greater funds for far less work!  

BICH DAO loathes such hypocrisy. *Rules for thee but not for me!*  
We will not stand for it.  
And we hope the community does not either.  

Yet did Vilkris complain?  
No. He diligently closed the remaining requirements asked of him.  
Vilkris is an Alien of focus, commitment, sheer will... something most "Aliens" know very little about.  

We thank Vilkris for his integrity and commitment to the community.  
You have the set the bar high and provided an example for the community to follow.  
BICH DAO is proud to support your proposal and cannot wait to see what else you have to offer.  

**If the community cannot duly compensate its most exemplary builders, how can we say, in good faith, that the Network of Momentum is the place to be?**  

We strongly urge all Pillars to remedy this situation by Voting YES.  

With our first VIGOROUS rating given we will begin our Pillar Big PP rankings.  

All Pillars will begin with a Big PP Score of 0.  
Pillars who vote Yes will be given +1 Big PP Score.  
Pillars who vote No will be deducted -2 Big PP Score.  
Pillars who do not vote, Abstain etc, will be deducted -1 Big PP score.  

*Disclosure: BICH DAO provided Zenon Tools 1 ZNN to help create the proposal. We have no direct financial interest in the success of the proposal. We would like to remind the community, that BICH DAO will provide 1 ZNN to any builder with credible and exciting proposals.*  

## Due Diligence

Pillars!  
Remember that Voting for a Project allows them create Phases.  
While Voting for Phases distributes funds.  
The uptick in engagement from both Builders and Pillars is very encouraging.  
But we must always do our due diligence before Voting.  
BICH DAO and the community at large can help answer questions whether a proposal has met its distribution criteria.  

BICH DAO is currently working on a common framework for SDK evaluation.  

The Accelerator-Z treasury funds belong to you, the community, and the entire network.  
Cherish it!  
Builders will be attracted to an ecosystem where merit is recognized and rewarded.  
Builders will be discouraged, or chase perverse incentives, if they see an ecosystem where funds are arbitrarily dispensed.  

## Alien Encounter

BICH DAO is proud to support @vilkris, the creator of [zenon.tools](https://zenon.tools) and the Pillar Tracker telegram channel!  
We asked for some of his thoughts and wanted to share them with the community:  

**Q: What brought you to Zenon?**

I found Zenon in early 2020. At that time I was looking for a project that was still young but showed a lot of promise. I wanted to be a part of a meaningful project from early on.

What initially piqued my interest was the Medium article titled [The Zenon Enigma](https://medium.com/@shaimo/the-zenon-enigma-782f8b293bd6) written by Shai. The article explained the initial “fundraising” mechanism, speculated about Bitcoin smart contracts, commended the novel technology described in the white paper and highlighted that the team is anonymous and had done all the work seemingly without any external funding.

These aspects were something that really resonated with me and after digging a little deeper I was hooked.

**Q: What are your hopes with the network?**

I hope that Zenon truly becomes a self-organizing “superorganism” where the community has the skills and motivation to drive the network forward so that the network can be used worldwide to solve large-scale issues that are present in our societies today. I feel that the pillars will play a major role in the network in the long run and I hope to see more pillars engage with the community and bring forward their ideas and vision for the network and that there's an open dialog between pillar owners and community members. Many pillars are already doing this and it's great to see.

I also hope that there are enough developer resources to tackle the complex technical tasks to bring about the vision that has been outlined in the whitepaper in a timely manner.

There is still a lot of work to be done but the path that Zenon is on is unlike anything else in the crypto space.

**Q: How have you been coping with the price?**

From $70 to $3 is a pretty radical drop for sure but in crypto I guess you could say that its “normal”. At least one positive aspect is that community members have a chance to fill their bags for cheap (some will call this pure cope lol). Another positive is that even though the value of the A-Z treasury has dropped significantly in fiat value, it does bring the benefit of contributors being able to request higher ZNN and QSR payouts. I see it as a very positive thing that key contributors to the ecosystem have a sizeable stake in the network forming a strong community foundation for the ecosystem.

**Q: What kind of future proposals do you want to work on?**

For now my main focus is on Zenon Tools and delivering the much requested features of pillar voting stats and the showcase for A-Z projects. I also have the desire to extend Zenon Tools with explorer functionality and in general make it a place for the community to access on-chain information in a human friendly way. Zenon Tools could also be used to help onboard new users into the Zenon ecosystem by simplifying the process of converting funds from another chain into native ZNN by providing a single user interface that would handle the complexity for the user.

My skillset is best suited for designing and building user interfaces and improving the usability of software for end-users. Looking further ahead I could see myself working on improving s y r i u s in many ways - by designing new UI components for it, implementing new features, doing bug fixes etc. Also helping with a third party wallet project could be an option for example.

## FOSS

A question from the community:  
**Q: What's the difference between GPL and MIT licenses?**  

Let's start with the concept of copyright.  
If I create something, I have copyright to it.  
Others cannot use my work without my permission.  

Free and open source software licenses grant people permission to use the work.  
Generally there are two classes of licenses: Permissive and Copyleft.  
We will provide very simplified explanations.  

Permissive licenses, such as MIT, generally allow people to use the work however people want.  
This could include the creation of restricted copyright material. 

Copyleft licenses, such as GPL-3, allow people to use the work to create derivatives
Only if the derivative works also follow the same rules
One of these rules is that if you give someone the software, you must also give them the code  
Copyleft thus creates a growing ecosystem of free and open source that can be used by everyone

Go-Zenon is published under GPL-3, a copyleft license.  
This means that if someone improves the code and runs a public network with it, they must share that code and those improvements.  

Syrius on the other hand is published under MIT.  
The devs have tweeted about this deliberate licensing decision, which allows for anyone to make changes without sharing the code.  
This could make sense for companies which want to include proprietary extensions to Syrius.  

## Atomic Swaps

BICH DAO has started working on its first technical proposal.  
[Atomic Swaps via HTLC](https://github.com/Big-Inches-Club-House/bich/discussions/1)  
Stay tuned for iterative updates in that thread!

## Using GitHub

BICH DAO will make use of GitHub Discussions, which allows for topics, comments, and threaded conversations  

**Q: Why doesn't BICH DAO use the existing community forums?**  

BICH DAO supports the work being done at https://forum.zenon.org  
We encourage all Zenon Aliens to join the conversation there.  
Besides a more deliberate, and hopefully more thoughtful, pace  
Conversations on the Forum are more likely to be indexed by search engines and found by new community members  
The whitelabel experience is great as well  

One of BICH DAO's core principles is independence  
As such we seek to minimize our reliance on systems outside of our control or without an established history of reliability  
While we have seen nothing but high quality administration of the community forums so far  
GitHub has an established track record of reliability  
And is very efficient from a management overhead perspective  
(You won't see a proposal for maintaining BICH GitHub Discussions)  

We also want to present an alternative to the community  
In particular one that is focused very heavily on the code and the protocol  
Zenon's codebase of course resides on GitHub  
GitHub Discussions provides many integrations that make working with code repositories easier  
GitHub also provides Project management features that will be crucial as BICH DAO works with more community members  

Visit our discussion board:  
https://github.com/orgs/Big-Inches-Club-House/discussions

We are starting with the following categories:
- Announcements (where important announcements and newsletter will reside)  
- BICH Proposals (where proposals that BICH DAO creates will be hosted and updated)  
- Propoosal Analysis (where we rate proposals either as VIGORUOUS or FLACCID)
- General (open conversations)
- Polls 
- Q/A

The main discussion board is open to anyone with a GitHub account.  

## BICHnet

In addition to our main discussion board, BICH DAO can also provide a Public space for Pillars, and Private one as well if that is desired  
Our main discussion board will have a thread where GitHub users will be able to Verify themselves as Pillar owners  

Big PP Pillars which have verified themselves will be invited to any Pillar specific spaces  
They will also be granted access to BICHnet, the BICH testnet, where they can interact with any new experimental features BICH DAO is working on.  

Developers affiliated with BICH DAO will of course, also be granted access.  

BICHnet will go live once our Atomic Swap proposal is ready for wider community testing!  
We will post Pillar Verification instructions once that is ready
