## Reeeeeeeeeee

*Mr Kaine, wen work with community?*  
*Mr Kaine, wen repo handover?*  
*Mr Kaine, notice me senpaiiiiiii*  

**BICH DAO will never beg for, grovel, or seek to borrow legitimacy.**  

How is it even possible when our $INCHES are so Big?  
Indeed, our handicap is also our Biggest strength.

Zenon is free and open source software supported by a passionate community of users.  
All that are willing to contribute, can.  
BICH DAO will work to destroy any perceived barriers.  

We have had great feedback on our newsletters so far.  
Thank you all for reading. Truly.  

In this and previous newsletters, BICH DAO has set into motion our short to mid term strategy.  
But these ideas require hard work to execute. We have started but will need to focus.   
We hope that in each newsletter edition, we can demonstrate meaningful progress towards our goals.  

Thus moving forward, we will release our newsletter on a slower but more regular cadence.  

Our next newsletter will contain instructions on how pillars can sign up for BICH DAO's placeholder communication systems.  
Our placeholder will serve us until we build a more Zenon native experience.  
We hope to quickly begin working with pillars and proposers to negotiate fair and exciting incentives for the hard work that community members have done and will continue to do.  
Hyperspace is of course our current focus.  

Optimistically speaking, our next newsletter will also include instructions on how to apply for the BICH Testnet (BICHnet)  

**Q: #WhereIsMrKaine ?**

# BICH Pleas

Big PP Pillars,  
BICH DAO has been made aware that many Pillars use the 'Voting Opened' filter.  
Currently the filter only displays Projects that can be voted on. And not their Phases.  
Don't worry we will go more in depth about the difference in the next section.  
We will also describe our plans to start working towards improvements in Syrius.  

There are currently more votes on the BICH News #3 Proposal than there are on the Completion Phase for BICH News #1  
**BICH DAO asks for Big PP Pillars to formally kick-off the DAO by voting to complete the 'Consummate the BICH DAO' phase of the BICH News #1 Project.**

Instructions:

1. Make sure the 'Voting opened' filter is turned off
2. Search for the BICH News #1 proposal.
3. Make sure the address ends with mchlwl (Don't vote for Sybil imitators)
4. In the future, we will publish the exact IDs of proposals which can be pasted in the search bar
5. Click on the proposal card.  
6. You will now see the project's phases if there are any.  
7. This phase requests 10 ZNN and 100 QSR, out of the project's total 10 ZNN 100 QSR request. (Completing the project) 
8. Vote YES on the phase  

Thank you to our friends who provided screenshots!

## AZ Deep Dive

BICH DAO has read through the code for Accelerator-Z  again

BICH DAO uses a lot of words.  
We'll try something new and use a diagram to explain how it works from a practical level.    

**Definitions:**  
Vote: Yes | No | Abstain | Not Valid (Pillars may change their votes)  
Quorum: At least 33% of pillars have voted  
Majority Approval: Of the votes submitted, there are more Yes than No votes  
Voting Period: 14 Days  

*Note that the voting period only applies to projects and not phases. But there is currently a bug in Syrius where it applies to Phases also*

```mermaid
flowchart TD

  id1(Start) -- Create Project. Send 1 ZNN to AZ --> id2(New Project Created. Status=Voting)
  id2 -. Project achieves Quorum and Majority Approval within Voting Period .-> id3(Project Status=Active)
  id2 -. Project does not achieve Quorum or Majority Approval within Voting Period .-> id4(Project Status=Closed)
  id3 -- Create Phase --> id5(New/Fresh Phase. Phase Status=Voting)
  id5 -. Update Phase. All votes Reset .-> id5
  id5 -. Phase achieves Quorum and Majority Approval .-> id6(Funds distribute, Phase Status=Paid)
  id6 -. No more project funds .-> id7(Project Status=Completed)
  id6 -. More funds available in project .-> id3

## Competition vs Collaboration

Recently, the Zenon Devs tweeted:  
https://twitter.com/Zenon_Network/status/1527690910959554560

```
Clash of the Aliens

There are two similar SDK projects being developed at the moment.

Typescript SDK has been proposed in A-Z  
http://forum.zenon.org/t/typescript-sdk/435

Javascript SDK is being developed on Github  
http://github.com/alien-valley/znn.js

Both SDKs are great initiatives, but competition is useful up to a certain point while collaboration is always more powerful and we must strive for it.

#NoM #AcceleratorZ #Hyperspace #DAO $ZNN $QSR
```

We wholeheartedly agree when it comes to competition vs collaboration.  
Some community members have asked us to clarify our stance.  

Competition places pressure on resource managers to ensure that scarce resources (e.g. AZ funds) are efficiently allocated.  
Innovation is often the product of repeated and failed experimentation.  
Competition encourages the investment of capital into such experimential ventures.  

Competition can thrive where trust doesn't exists.  
However, there are diminishing returns.  
For example, experience and lessons learned are not shared, leading to redundancy.  

Trust lowers the frictional costs of communication.
Where trust exists, collaboration is possible.  
By sharing ideas and risk, those within the trust boundary are able to achieve efficiencies not possible through competition.  

One reason why BICH DAO is so excited about the future of NoM is that its delegation mechanism incentivizes trust building.  

Our approach remains unchanged.  
BICH DAO will seek to compete where competition is lacking and trust does not exist.  
We also pursue trust building and collaboration by working with community members who share our values.  

## Our Promise

In a community chat, a terrible allegation was made against the BICH DAO.  
We vehemently reject it and will repost it here to make our position clear.  

```
Community Member:  
I don’t agree with the AZ proposal BICH news.  
BICH spells out as Bitch out loud so it’s very misogynistic and will offend our women community members.  
I hope Zenon can be an inclusive community for all genders and women can be (more) equal than men.  
Please reconsider voting for BICH news because it’s very offensive.  

Our response: 
As the BICH DAO becomes diverse, we will hold internal votes for any name changes/rebranding.  
BICH stands for Big Inches Club House.  
We welcome all with $INCHES.  
Men and women alike.  
Or anything in between.  
We are very inclusive.  
We are not sure how people are making the connection between BICH and the term "bitch".  
There is a whole unit of Levenshtein distance between them.  
In any case, we have found the term "bitch" to apply to many men.  
So even interpreted in the wrong way, BICH DAO is again inclusive.  
```

We consider this matter settled and will not dignify any further allegations of this nature.  

**To make the point very clear:**  
**BICH DAO is willing to work with any Zenon Alien, regardless of species, race, gender, identity, or even skillset.**  
**All that matters to BICH DAO is common fundamental values and the will to fight for them.**  

## BIACH

BICH DAO will begin construction of the Big $INCHES Auction Clearing House (BIACH)  
The Zenon community has no shortage of rare valuable art and historical relics.  
For deserving community members, BICH DAO will help brings these artifacts onto NoM and auction them off if so desired.  

## Alien Valley

BICH DAO welcomes Alien Valley Pillar back into the game.

## Work with us

In the spirit of collaboration, BICH DAO is seeking out individuals for the following:  
1. Marketing
2. UX
3. Protocol
4. Management

Accelerator-Z  provides a new and untested revenue model.  
Web2 is often characterized by its users being the product, while priorities lie on the true customer: advertising dollars.  
Even if this is not the case, often times compromises are made to ensure survival.  

One fundamental question that BICH DAO embodies:  
**Can an organization sustain itself while pursuing complete independence as it serves its community?**  

BICH DAO will seek to create sustainable revenue models for its contributors that align completely with the community it serves.  

### Marketing
As clearly seen in previous sections, the Zenon community is filled with brilliant creatives.  
We also have expert marketers in our community.  

We live in troubled times. To those in our community recovering their strength, rest well.  
We will light the torch and carry it as far as we can.  
We eagerly await your return to fight side by side.  

While Zenon Aliens so far have been able to create incredibly engaging and entertaining content  
And also have started to read and understand the principles expressed in our go-zenon scriptures  
These efforts have not yet converged.  

BICH DAO seeks to change this.  

BICH DAO seeks to combine engaging community content and Zenon's profound principles  
We will engineer and release the mind viruses needed which can survive in today's harsh cultural environment  

Most crypto content is created by corporate entities only focusing on the scope of their corporate interests.  
Zenon will usher in a collaborative multi-chain future.  

Writers, artists, content creators, please reach out.  

### UX

There are many improvements to Syrius wallet that can be worked on immediately which will create great value for the entire community.  

These include:
- Bugfixes
- Address Book
- Tooltips/Tutorial
- Autoreceive Options
- Basic NFT Support
- Mobile and QR code support
- Merchant mode/invoicing
- And many more!

Any advancements made to the protocol, such as smart contracts, will also be useless without mirroring innovation in our clients and wallets.  
We believe our community, even now, has the strength to begin tackling these items.  

As such BICH DAO is seeking individuals with skills in Dart, Javascript/Typescript, mobile and frontend web development.  
For those interested, please reach out!  

### Protocol

Last but certainly not least, BICH DAO will seek to conduct Protocol research.  
BICH DAO will seek to understand the NoM protocol and make suggestions for upgrades.  
We will define an internal ZIP process that we will then share with the community at large.  

BICH DAO will also create internal applications while researching how to turn them into decentralized protocols.  
For now, our primary tech backend stack will be Golang as we work closely with the go-zenon codebase.  

For those interested, please reach out!  

### Management

Dear Big PP pillars,  
You and the community you represent are BICH DAO's board of directors.  
BICH DAO will create a management team to execute your will.  
As more join our efforts, and as we decentralize the BICH DAO treasury, we will hold elections for management positions.  

## Community

Community members have started reaching out to us asking if they can contribute  
And we have started to reach out to those who we believe share our vision and can fight  

Do you believe in the promise of decentralized currencies?  
Do you laugh in the face of bear markets as you lose "life-changing money"(tm)?  
Do you steadfastly contribute, and refuse to quit, even when things aren't going your way?

We will be honored to work with you

This week use Twitter hashtag \#PillarDown to share with us  

Last newsletter, we invited Zenon-chan and Quasar-Chan to join the BICH DAO.  
Unfortunately, they have rejected our invitation.
